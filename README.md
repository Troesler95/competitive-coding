# Competitive Coding
This respository is a keepsake for my solutions to various competitive coding problems found across the web
as practice for the CCSCNE and ACM coding competitions. 

My solutions are very often not the most optimal (if ever). That is not the point of this repository. The object is to show
my progression as a problem solver in C++ for future employers or those looking for my skill thus far. Feel free to use my
solutions as a reference point for your own projects and I am always open to hearing a more optimal solution to a problem.
