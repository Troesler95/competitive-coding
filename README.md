# Competitive Coding
This respository is a keepsake for my solutions to various competitive coding problems found across the web
as practice for the CCSCNE and ACM coding competitions. 

My solutions are very often not the most optimal (if ever). That is not the point of this repository. The object is to show
my progression as a problem solver in C++ for future employers or those looking for my skill thus far. Often I look for an equal balance between an optimal and eloquent solution. 
Feel free to use my solutions as a reference point for your own projects and I am always open to hearing a more optimal solution to a problem.

All folders contain a main.cpp which was developed from a linux (debian) terminal using nano and compiled using the command `g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp`. I often use the range-based for loop introduced in C++11, so the `-std=c++11` flag is necessary if you are compiling these yourself. Likewise, I try to include either links or PDFs of the problem I am currently solving so viewers can see the problem and example solutions to match with my solutions.
